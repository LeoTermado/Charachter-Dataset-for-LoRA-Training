# Realistic Character Dataset Guide for LoRA Training

This project is a specialized guide for building **high-quality image datasets** to train LoRA models focused on **realistic, human-like AI female characters** using Stable Diffusion.

If you're creating a custom LoRA of a realistic-looking female model — not anime, not stylized — this guide is built for you. It provides a structured, field-tested approach to dataset creation that aligns with best practices in LoRA fine-tuning.

## 📦 What's Inside

- 🧱 **Tiered Image Breakdown** (up to 150 images):  
  Carefully structured into 4 tiers — from clean full-body foundation shots to complex lighting and expressive portraits — designed for learning character identity across real-world conditions.

- 🧠 **Realism-Only Focus**:  
  Every instruction is geared toward training on **realistic photo-style humans**, not anime, game renders, or stylized content.

- 🖼️ **Pose, Angle, and Lighting Coverage**:  
  Includes specific recommendations for full-body angles, lighting setups (e.g. rim light, golden hour, candlelight), and neutral to expressive variations — all optimized for realistic model retention.

- 🏷️ **Prompt + Captioning Strategy**:  
  Clear guidance on what to tag, what to avoid, and how to format prompts and captions for best generalization during training.

- ⚙️ **Folder Naming Helper**:  
  Dynamically generate clean dataset structure and naming patterns for instance/class tokens.

- ✅ **Final Checklist**:  
  Sanity-check your dataset before training.

## 🧠 Why This Guide Matters

Training a LoRA for a realistic female character isn't just about collecting pretty images — it's about:
- Balanced full-body and portrait coverage
- Consistent captioning and tag structure
- Lighting, pose, and expression variation — **without losing identity**

This guide reflects real-world LoRA training logic and is structured to maximize **character fidelity and generation consistency**.
