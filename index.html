    <!-- Chosen Palette: Deep Forest & Ocean Mist (Dark Green, Navy Blue, and light neutrals) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A task-oriented, single-page guide designed to walk a user from theory to practice. The structure is thematic, not linear like the report. It starts with core concepts ("The Why"), moves to ideal dataset criteria ("The What" - presented as an interactive grid), then to a practical "Curation Workbench" with interactive tools (sliders, dynamic text, charts) for hands-on learning, and finishes with a summary checklist and next steps. This structure was chosen to transform a dense text report into an actionable tool, making complex concepts like file naming and image counts tangible and easy to grasp. The "Image Collection Blueprint" section provides a progressive, detailed image list, allowing users to build their dataset in stages from foundational to advanced variations, now with clickable prompts for each image that appear on hover. A new social media segment has been added at the very end for creator contact. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: 9 Optimal Dataset Criteria (Table 1) -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: Interactive expandable cards in a grid -> Interaction: Click to reveal details -> Justification: Breaks down complex info into manageable, user-driven chunks, more engaging than a static table. -> Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Recommended Image Count -> Goal: Compare/Inform -> Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart -> Interaction: Static visualization for comparison -> Justification: Fulfills the mandatory Chart.js requirement by clearly comparing recommended dataset sizes for different goals, providing an immediate visual anchor for the user. -> Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Image Count Slider -> Goal: Inform/Explore -> Viz: HTML Range Slider -> Interaction: Drag to see count and qualitative feedback change -> Justification: Makes the concept of dataset size interactive and personal. -> Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: File Organization -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Live-updating folder name generator -> Interaction: User types into inputs, sees result -> Justification: Demystifies the specific naming convention by making it a practical, interactive tool. -> Library: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Captioning Rule -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Side-by-side columns -> Interaction: Static visual -> Justification: Clearly contrasts the two essential parts of the captioning strategy. -> Library: HTML/CSS.
        - Updated: Detailed Image Breakdown (150 images) -> Goal: Guide/Prescribe -> Viz: Detailed, categorized text lists with dynamic prompt display on hover -> Interaction: Hover to show button, click to show/hide prompt -> Justification: Provides granular, step-by-step instructions for dataset curation and now offers direct, model-specific prompt examples for each image, enhancing practical application while maintaining a clean UI. -> Library: Vanilla JS to generate the list content and handle button clicks/prompt display.
        - New: Socials Segment -> Goal: Connect/Inform -> Viz: Text and Button Link -> Interaction: Click to navigate -> Justification: Provides a direct call to action for user support/connection, a standard pattern for informational guides. -> Library: HTML/CSS.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.

                <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-2 text-slate-300">This section provides an exact breakdown of 150 images to build a comprehensive LoRA dataset for your naked female character. Since clothing and poses will be controlled externally, the focus here is on varying facial expressions, lighting, camera angles, and subtle body views to capture the character's core identity. Progress through these tiers to incrementally enhance your model. Hover over an image description and click "Show Prompt" for a suggested generation prompt for each image.</p>
